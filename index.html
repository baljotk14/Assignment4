<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi!<br>
    My name is <strong>Baljot</strong>. I am a fourth year </strong>Computer Science major.</strong><br>
     I love to <strong>cook</strong>, especially when I am mad, it is like my stress buster.
      I enjoy spending time in <strong>nature</strong>, go hiking or simple walks, watching sunset.
       Watching movies, korean/chinese dramas is what I love to do in my me time.<br>
        I usually spend my free time hanging out with friends, going to new places or my family. 
        I do have an idea of what I want to do in future or what kind of a person<br>
         I want to be but I like to go with the flow and see how things go without having
          a full layout of things like I want to achieve this by next year. I am not too good
           but I do like <strong>photography</strong>. Here are some of the recent pictures I took!<br>
           I am inserting a picture of sunset I like (not taken by me)!<br>
